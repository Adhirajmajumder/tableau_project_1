# Sales Performance Analysis

Create a bullet chart with Category and Segment dimensions and Sales measures. 

Blend the data with the Saved Sample - Sales Target data set to bring in the Sales Target measure. 

Color code the chart to identify Categories and Segments that are above or below target. 

Add the year of sales to the view to identify trends and outliers. 

Add a filter so that the user can select one, more than one, or all years. 

Create a dashboard with this view.
